# Wiki page format (always loaded)

Every file under `wiki/` obeys these rules. They are enforced by `/wiki-lint` and by the CI workflow.

## Frontmatter (required)

```yaml
---
title: "Human-readable title"
type: source | entity | concept | synthesis | comparison | question | archive
tags: [tag1, tag2]
sources: [source-slug-1, source-slug-2]      # only for entity/concept/synthesis
last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```

Every field is required except `sources` (source pages don't have them).

## Naming conventions

| Page type | Directory | Slug format | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| Source | `wiki/sources/` | `kebab-case` (matches raw slug) | `clever-munching-parnas.md` |
| Entity | `wiki/entities/` | `TitleCase` | `AndrejKarpathy.md` |
| Concept | `wiki/concepts/` | `TitleCase` | `RetrievalAugmentedGeneration.md` |
| Synthesis | `wiki/syntheses/` | `kebab-case` | `what-did-i-decide-about-quarkus.md` |
| Comparison | `wiki/comparisons/` | `kebab-case` | `karpathy-llm-wiki-vs-rag.md` |
| Question | `wiki/questions/` | `kebab-case` | `should-we-ship-obsidian-adapter.md` |
| Archive | `wiki/archive/` | same as original | `deprecated-slug.md` |

## Hard rules

1. **Every page has a `## Connections` section** with at least one `[[wikilink]]`.
2. **`[[wikilinks]]` must resolve** — `/wiki-lint` fails on broken links.
3. **Frontmatter `last_updated` must match** the most recent edit (updated automatically on ingest).
4. **Never silently overwrite** — conflicting claims go under `## Contradictions` with both cited.
5. **Slugs are immutable once published.** Rename via archive + redirect, not in place.
