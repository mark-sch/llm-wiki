```jsonl
{"type": "user", "content": "...", ...}

```

## Known record types

## Are you willing to contribute this adapter?

- [ ] Yes, I'll open a PR
- [ ] I can help test but not write code

## Contract reminder

Per `docs/framework.md §5.25 Adapter Flow`, a new adapter needs:

1. `llmwiki/adapters/<agent>.py`
2. `tests/fixtures/<agent>/minimal.jsonl`
3. `tests/snapshots/<agent>/minimal.md`
4. `tests/test_<agent>_adapter.py`
5. `docs/adapters/<agent>.md`
6. README update
7. CHANGELOG entry
